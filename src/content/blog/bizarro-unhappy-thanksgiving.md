Unhappy and unsafe Thanksgiving wishes from Bizarro World! What are you unthankful for this year?

<img src="/assets/images/blog/bizarro-thanksgiving.jpg" alt="Bizarro Thanksgiving" />

But seriously&hellip;

**Happy Thanksgiving!** I hope you have a wonderful day filled with family, friends, and good food. And if you're not in the U.S. or don't celebrate Thanksgiving, I hope you have a wonderful day filled with family, friends, and good food anyway! 🦃🍁🍽️
