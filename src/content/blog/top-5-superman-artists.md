With his debut in _Action Comics #1_ in 1939, Superman launched the comic book superhero. During his 72 year history, the Man of Steel's adventures have been illustrated by many of the greatest artists in the comic book industry. These men are not only great illustrators and storytellers but during their tenures as Superman artists they produced the seminal work in Superman's ongoing battle for **"Truth, Justice and the American Way!"**

  ### **5** Neal Adams

  Neal Adams was one of the pioneers of realism in comic book illustration. Adams exploded onto the scene in the late Silver Age and by the early 1970s he was one of the most sought after talents in the industry. His contribution to the Man of Steel are hundreds of beautiful covers for _Action Comics, Superman_ and _Superboy_ (not to mention Superman as part of the _JLA_). Unfortunately, he drew interiors for only one issue of _Superman_, Issue #254.

  Joe Shuster, with writer Joel Siegel, kicked off the age of the Superheroes _(which I’m happy to say is still alive and well)_. Compared to the art in a modern comic book, Shuster’s work appears less polished _(true)_ and more juvenile _(arguable)_. One thing his art has in spades is energy. Leaf through an early_ Action Comics_ or _Superman_ comic and you can see why the Man of Steel captured the imaginations of generations of the young at heart. Joe Shuster made everyone **“believe a man can fly”**.

  ### **3** John Byrne

  By the late 1980s, Superman was in a bit of a creative rut. Superman was seen by many fans as hopelessly out-of-date and increasingly irrelevant. He was your **GRAND**father's superhero. 
  
  After DC's major spring cleaning event, _Crisis on Infinite Earths_, John Byrne was tapped to modernize the company’s flagship character. Byrne toned-down Superman's god-level powers, scrapped some of the crazier aspects of Superman canon _(such as a full spectrum of crazy kryptonite colors)_. His high-energy artwork _(Byrne is a master of superhero battles)_ leapt off the page in 1986's _Man of Steel_ miniseries and his subsequent reboot of _Action Comics_ and _Superman_.

  Curt Swan is the quintessential Superman artist of the 1950s, 60s and 70s. He drew Superman in _Action Comics, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, Superman_, and _World's Finest_, and drew Superboy in _Adventure Comics_ for over 3 decades. His swan song _(sorry...this pun was too good to leave in the holster)_ was the “final Superman story” _Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow (Superman #423 &amp; Action Comics #583)_ in 1985 as DC prepared to reboot of their iconic character in _Man of Steel_.

  If you own a Superman lunchbox, t-shirt, button or other piece of merch, chances are you own a piece of Garcia-Lopez's artwork. 

  Besides his stints as penciller on _Action Comics_, _Superman_ and _Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes_, Garcia-Lopez also defined and refined the look of the DC Universe in _DC Comics Style Guide_ in 1982. Garcia-Lopez is the **Artist’s** Artist and his mark on the Man of Steel _(and the wider DC Universe)_ endures to this day.
