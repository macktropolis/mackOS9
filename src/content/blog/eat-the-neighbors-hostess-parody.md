In the spooky spirit of Halloween, I've exhumed a delightful treat for you! Feast your eyes on this playful _Marvel Zombies_ parody from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Phillips" target="_blank">Sean Phillips</a> and <a href="https://www.marvel.com/" target="_blank">Marvel Comics</a>, inspired by those iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostess_Brands" target="_blank">Hostess</a> fruit pie ads that sweetened the pages of comic books throughout the '70s and '80s. Enjoy this nostalgic nibble of comic book history with a ghoulish twist! It's __deliciously__ grisly. ðŸŽƒ
